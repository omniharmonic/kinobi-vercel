## Documentation Framework

1. Purpose

   - Guide without constraining
   - Enable knowledge sharing

2. Organization
   - /ref/: External references and standards
   - /temp/: Work in progress documentation
   - /arch/: Architecture and design docs
   - Project docs live outside .cursor/

3. Best Practices
