## Workspace Philosophy

1. Separation of Concerns
   - Project space: Core functionality and implementation
   - .cursor/: Development guidance and support only
   - Clear boundaries between scaffolding and project

2. Scaffolding Principles
   - Non-invasive: Support without interference
   - Discoverable: Clear organization of development resources
   - Portable: Scaffolding independent of project specifics
   - Extensible: Framework for project-specific rules

3. Key Relationships
   - Rules guide but don't restrict
   - Documentation supports but doesn't define
   - Tools assist but don't require
